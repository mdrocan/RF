# Dockerized test environment for XML and REST validation

The test environment is based on Alpine and Nginx images in Docker containers.
It is created fairly easily using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Used test framework: [Robot Framework](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework)
#1 Dependency test libraries/modules are installed during the setup and execution phase.
#2 Currently included testing activities: XML and REST reply verifications.
#3 Does not use SeleniumLibrary or browsers.

## Commands to get the environment working:

A new environment is created using Virtualbox and it is named as: testing 
```
docker-machine create -d virtualbox testing
```

Take the (newly) created environment into use.
```
eval $(docker-machine env testing)
```

HTTP application is started.
```
docker-compose up -d web
```

Test execution: Parameter for XML verification: xml-validation, for REST verification: rest-validation. A separate environment for dev/testing activities: validate-env
OBS: #1 The REST verification test are using the following service: http://echo.jsontest.com . #2 Should improve testing and recognize failing situations better.
```
docker-compose run 'parameter'
```

Shut down the whole test environment.
```
docker-compose down
```

Remove the whole test environment/cleanup.
```
docker-machine rm -f testing
```
