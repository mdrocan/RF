# Dockerized test environment for XML and REST validation

The test environment is based on Alpine and Nginx images in Docker containers.
It is created fairly easily using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Used test framework: [Robot Framework](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework)
1) Dependency test libraries/modules are installed during the setup and execution phase.
2) Currently included testing activities: XML and REST reply verifications.
3) Does not use SeleniumLibrary or browsers.

## Commands to get the environment working:

Create a new environment using Virtualbox and name it 'testing':
```
docker-machine create -d virtualbox testing
```

Take the created environment into use:
```
eval $(docker-machine env testing)
```

Start the HTTP application:
```
docker-compose up -d web
```

Test execution:
i) XML verification: xml-validation ii) REST verification: rest-validation.
A separate environment for dev/testing activities: validate-env
OBS:
1) The REST verification test is using the following service: http://echo.jsontest.com.
2) Should improve testing and recognize failing situations better.
```
docker-compose run 'parameter'
```

Shut down the test environment.
```
docker-compose down
```

Remove the test environment/cleanup.
```
docker-machine rm -f testing
```
